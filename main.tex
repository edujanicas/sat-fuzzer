\section{Introduction}  
We have implemented a black-box fuzzer using the Python programming language. It can be run in two different modes, which will be referred to as \texttt{ub} mode and \texttt{func} mode in the following sections. It also makes use of a seed provided as an argument which allows our fuzzer to exhibit a deterministic behaviour.

\section{\texttt{ub} mode}

\section{\texttt{func} mode}
When using this mode, the fuzzer behaves in a \textit{blind} fashion, generating new inputs by mutating pre-existing formulae. Only valid inputs will be generated in this phase.

We have developed a set of rules to create new formulae, which can be chained together to generate more complex transformations of existing inputs.

These rules are outlined below:

    # Apply a set of transformations based on these rules:
    # 0 - 4 Swap clauses (1)
    # 5 - 9 Swap literals inside a clause (2)
    # 10 - 14 Add clauses (3)
    # 15 - 19 Remove Clauses (4)
    # 20 - 24 (1+2)
    # 25 - 29 (1+3)
    # 30 - 34 (1+4)
    # 35 - 39 (2+3)
    # 40 - 44 (1+2+3)
    # 45 - 49 (1+2+4)
